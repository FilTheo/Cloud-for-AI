> this is a repo for a time series forecasting workshop I am giving. slides are in @"slides/Workshop_slides_only_1
(3)-1.pdf". Workshop notebooks are in @practical/py_files/ ... I have generated a new dataframe in
@practical/clear_data.ipynb named converted_2.csv. Your task is to create a new notebook called end_to_end.ipynb
which will use everything I taught them in a single notebook. It will visualize some series as I do, show strength
(aggregated) of seasonality etc, like in the start. Then generate forecasts using simple models and statistical
using statsforecast. Finally we will do global models using mlforecast as i do in the proper sesion. skip neural
networks. We will do cross-validation with 2 metrics, one will be mean absolute scaled error and the other root mean
 squared scaled error. You will define these metrics and define cross-validation as I do on the slides. root mean
squared scaled error (rmsse) is different thant rmse. its a scaled version. check the web if you dont know how to
find it. do lag selection, simple feature engineering (as in the other notebook, with date features and two types of
 normalizations) for lgbm and linear regression, then generate pltos for the predictions as on all sessions and some
 aggregated statistics. make it end to end to mimick the last section of the slides based on the format nad
structures I have on the sessions. think carefully here. genreate the new .ipynb. do not read .ipynb files. only .py
 files on @practical/py_files/ that fit on your context window
